       //   Variables

 /*

var : Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope.

let : Variable cannot be re-declared but cannot be updated. A block scope.

const : Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope.

let message = "Hello javascript":  // this is how we assign the value in variable.

alert(message);  //This will print "Hello javascript" in console"


//we can also acess variables by their name

let message;
message = "Hello javascript";

alert(message);  //Prints the variable content.

//for better code practice we should end our code with semi-colon(;)
